## Why Am I Doing This?

I wanted to come up with some sort of challenge for myself that would let me a.) add projects to my resume and b.) add to this blog.

## The Challenge

The challenge is simple. As best as I can with the limited time I have every day, I want to find something to either learn or do related to infosec and cybersecurity. Every day once I've finished the task I set for myself, I'll write up that days' blog post. I don't want to limit myself in terms of projects/topics but some things that have come to mind while brainstorming this are:

1. HTB machines
2. Programming projects (that are small enough to complete with the time I have)
3. HTB Academy articles (where I'd write up a blog post on what I learned, trying to not just be a summary)

The programming projects can be anything from learning about writing malware, security tools, etc. This list doesn't encompass everything but I'm sure it covers a lot of things I could do.

I also want to make sure that I'm not just doing things I'm comfortable with. I want to push myself to learn new things and get out of my comfort zone. Hopefully I'm able to do that.

Because I work full time and have two kids, I may miss a day. I will absolutely try not to so that I can keep to the spirit of the challenge but give me some grace here.

## What Next?

Look for the articles tagged with [30 days of cyber](/tags/30-days-of-cyber). Posts should also start with a "Day..." title and can be found using that.
